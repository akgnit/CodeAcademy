In this course, you'll learn how to deploy an static site to the Internet.

What exactly do we mean by deploy, or deploying?

Deploying means making content or software accessible and available for use.

The website that you'll deploy in this course will be public, or "live", on the Internet. It will be accessible to anyone (with open Internet access), at anytime, anywhere in the world.

By the end of this course, you will have:

Generated a static site
Deployed it to the Internet
Given the website a custom domain name
Let's begin!
The diagram to the right illustrates the three main steps we'll cover in this course â€” (1) generating the site, (2) deploying it to the public Internet, and (3) assigning it a custom domain name. We'll walk through each of these steps in the order they appear on the diagram.

Note: We'll make extensive use of the command line and Git in this course. If you need to review, check out the corresponding Codecademy courses:
