The focus of this course will be on the process of deploying a website, not on actually creating a website.

We'll use a popular tool known as Jekyll to quickly generate a website. This will help keep the focus on the deployment process and quickly provide you with content to deploy, rather than focusing solely on website creation.

Jekyll is a simple static site generator. Using Jekyll is a very common way of generating a "ready-to-publish static website" within seconds. You can learn more about Jekyll here.

An important note:

The reason this course uses Jekyll is so that we can generate the static website quickly and focus on deploying it. However, we understand that you may not want to use the Jekyll-generated content.

In that case, it is possible to follow all of the steps outlined in this course with your own content â€” just make sure that your HTML is inside of a file called index.html. As you'll see, even Jekyll uses a file called index.html.

If instead you'd like to learn about creating static sites (starting from scratch), check out our Make a Website course.
Take a look at the official Codecademy blog in the browser to the right. It's meant to give you a sense of how fully you can customize a Jekyll site.

By the end of this unit, you'll have your own Jekyll-generated website ready to deploy.
