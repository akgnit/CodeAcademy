Function Syntax
The typical structure of a function is as follows:

function name(parameters) {
  statement;
}
The keyword function indicates that the code following it will be a user-defined function.

name indicates the name of a function, which is case insensitive. The name of a function can contain numbers, letters, underscores or dashes.

The arguments, or parameters, will be the optional input a function uses to perform calculations.

And of course, the statements themselves will be the code the function executes when it is called.
