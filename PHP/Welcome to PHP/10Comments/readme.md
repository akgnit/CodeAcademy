Comments

Just like we sometimes put comments in our CSS (using /* this syntax */) or in our HTML (using <!-- this syntax -->), we can also put comments in our PHP code! We do that using two forward slashes (//), like so:

<?php
    echo "I get printed!";
    // I don't! I'm a comment.
?>

Instructions

Go ahead and add a comment to our PHP code. It can say whatever you like!
