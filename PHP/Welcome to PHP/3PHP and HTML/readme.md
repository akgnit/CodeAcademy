PHP and HTML
PHP code can be written right into your HTML, like this:

<body>
  <p>

    <?php
      echo "I'm learning PHP!";
    ?>

  </p>
</body>
Your PHP code goes inside the <?php and ?> delimiters. Here we use the function echo to output I'm learning PHP!. We also end the line with a semicolon.

Instructions

Try it out. On line 8, use echo to output your name. Make sure to end your line with a semicolon.
