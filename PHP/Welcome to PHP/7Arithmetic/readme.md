Arithmetic
In addition to outputting strings, PHP can also do math.

<?php
  echo 5 * 7;
?>
Here we use echo to multiply 5 and 7, and we end our line of code with a semicolon. PHP will output 35.

Instructions

On line 8 in between the <?php and ?>, use echo to calculate 17 * 123. Make sure to end your PHP code with a semicolon.
