Putting It All Together, Part I

Well done! You've reconstructed the Person class.

Let's create another class: a Dog class. It should have a public property $numLegs, which stores the value 4. Furthermore, there should be the possibility to give every dog a $name using a __constructor.

Of course we also need some methods, as a dog is able to bark(). Our dogs are also able to introduce themselves, to greet(), so we'll also need a method for this.

At last we'll need two cute dogs. :-)

That's it. Let's start!

Note: You'll find the basic syntax for the tasks in the hints, so don't worry. :-)
And although this looks like a huge task, it's actually quite easy. :-)

So this time let's create our class and add the properties.

Instructions
Add the <?php ?> tag.
Create a Dog class.
Add a public property called $numLegs, which stores the value 4 to the Dog class.
Add another public property called $name, which doesn't contain a value.
Add the __construct()or method, which accepts $name as a parameter.
In this __construct()or method, add some code, so $this->name contains $name.
