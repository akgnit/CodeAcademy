Challenge Time

Awesome! Now let's try the same without the training wheels. :-P

Let's create a Cat class, which has two public properties: an $isAlive property storing the value true and a $numLegs property containing the value 4.

There should be a public $name property, which should get a value when a new object is created, so assign the value to $name via the __construct() method.

Then I also want these Cats to be able to meow, so add a meow() method, which returns "Meow meow".

Finally, create an instance of the Cat class, which has the $name "CodeCat" and store it in the variable $cat1. Then call the meow() method on this cat.

Sounds doable? Then let's start the challenge. :-)
