Review

Well done, mission accomplished. :-)

In this course you've learnt the basics of object-oriented programming, or OOP for short:

You know what a class is.

You know what an object is.

You know that you create objects using classes, as you simply create an instance of a class to create a new object.

You know how to create classes and objects.

You know how to add properties to a class.

You know how to add methods to a class.

You know how to use the __construct() method and the new keyword.

You know the arrow notation.

Actually you know quite a lot. :-)
The next course even dives deeper in OOP and you'll learn some nice concepts like inheritance or what constants are.
If you want to, you may have a look at the hint. :-)

Instructions
