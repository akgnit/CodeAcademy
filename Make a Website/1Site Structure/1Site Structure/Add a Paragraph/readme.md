The webpage now has a heading and a tagline. Next, we will add a description of the company.

The HTML paragraph element, p, is used to hold one or more sentences, just like paragraphs in an essay or a book.

<p>Paragraph text here</p>
Let's use a paragraph element to add the company description.

Instructions

1.
Below the h3 element, add a paragraph element that contains a description of the company. Here's an example:

<p>Need a set of wheels while you're in town? Use Ollie to pair your perfect vacation with a stylish, affordable bike rental.</p>
Click Run.

In the web browser, notice how text enclosed by the p tags is smaller than heading text and is not bold.
